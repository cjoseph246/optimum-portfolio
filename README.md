# optimum-portfolio

Using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance....
Webpage takes up to 5 stocks and start/end dates to inform client which allocation
would generate the highest returns with lowest risk.

Plots the normalized data (i.e. each stock price normalized to 100) to show stock price levels.

Also, generates a plot of the efficient frontier.

Heavy lifting done with numpy, pandas, and flask.
